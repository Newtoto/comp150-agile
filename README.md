The question I will be addressing in this essay is "How can the daily stand-up be adjusted to accommodate for a project which lacks a central office space and common working hours?". I will be finding solutions to the problems that arrise from working in a university setting where students are working from different locations and work to different scedules. In order to find these solutions, I will be drawing parrallels between this setting and that of global software development where workers operate mostly though online tools and have no real central workspace, this should allow me to draw new ideas into the classroom setting.
