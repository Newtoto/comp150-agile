The question I will be addressing in this essay is "How can the daily stand-up be adjusted to accommodate for a project which lacks a central office space and common working hours?". I will be finding solutions to the problems that arrise from working in a university setting where students are working from different locations and work to different scedules. In order to find these solutions, I will be drawing parrallels between this setting and that of global software development where workers operate mostly though online tools and have no real central workspace, this should allow me to draw new ideas into the classroom setting.

<h3>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.falmouth.ac.uk/document/6226091/ - Chaos issues on communication in Agile Global Software Development:</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>D lack of frequent face to face: This issue resulted in development team relying more on asynchronous communication as well as informal communication example using email because the right person is not available when it is needed </li>
<li>G lack of commitment/teamwork: Sometimes problems do happened where team members only communicate with selected people in the team for example only communicate with the Software Architect, communication is affected because team members do not wish to contribute to communicate with each other. Lack of formal communication may also lead to lower team spirit </li>
<li>H Different working hours/time zones:  This resulted in the difficulties of scheduling group meetings outside normal working hours during certain time of the year due especially during the winter because of the shorter time as well as difficult to conduct long meeting example Sprint planning meeting</li>
<li>I miscommunication of requirements: The main element in producing software that is useable and it is constantly evolving due to changes by the customers[31]. Developers have to come up with their own detailed requirement based on their previous experience and at the same time trying to understand what customer need [33]</li>
<li>J low quality of telecommunication bandwidth</li>
<li>L unprepared communication tools</li>
<li>M poor communication infrastructure</li>
